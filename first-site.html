        <h3> Anakin </h3>
        <p> Let's talk about my dog Anakin first. He is an American pitbull and he is 1 years old. We got him when he was 7 months old. Despite being a pitbull he is very nice and calm to the people he knows and he loves new people who are not so calm though he will jump and lick people he doesn't know well. </p>
        <h3>Gannan</h3>
        <p> Gannan is my younger of the two cats but the one we have had the longest. He is 11 years old and we got him when he was 6 months old. He is a siamese cat who's calm until someone holds him he doesn't know or if you hold him the wrong way.</p>
        <h3> Tigrah </h3>
        <p>Tigrah is my older of the 2 cats and she is technically my nannies cat so I donâ€™t know when she got her. Tigrah hates being picked up and will most likely claw you or scream as loud as physically possible for a cat.</p>
